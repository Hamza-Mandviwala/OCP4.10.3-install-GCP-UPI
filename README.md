# OpenShift 4.10 installation on GCP using UPI method

*UPDATE (6th September 2023) : Recently, you might notice gcloud commands failing due to permission errors, this is because the gcloud CLI now requires you to login using the `gcloud auth` command. The step no.19 in this exercise has been updated to reflect the same.*

*UPDATE (14th September 2022) : The exercise demonstrated in this GitHub project uses OpenShift version 4.10.3. However, it can also be used as a guide for installing almost any 4.10.x as well as 4.11.1 version of OpenShift on GCP using the UPI Method. Tested at my end, and it works perfectly on 4.11.1 as well. Some GCP UI changes might be seen now, however these are very minor and shouldn't have much impact on the installation flow.*

This guide is intended to walk you through a step-by-step procedure of deploying a 5 node (3 Masters & 2 Workers) OCP 4.10 cluster on GCP using the User-Provisioned-Infrastructure (UPI) method. It will help you understand what goes into deploying an OpenShift cluster from scratch all the way from setting up the infra components up to the actual OpenShift software installation.

We have selected GCP as our infrastructure platform, mainly because it offers some free credits upon account creation to get yourself familiarized with the platform. This is more than enough to get our RedHat OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 up and running seamlessly using the UPI method at no cost at all.

This guide also covers a lot of basics including the creation of basic GCP components like projects, networks etc. So, if you are comfortable with provisioning your infrastructure components yourself, feel free to skip over to the [openshift installation](https://github.com/Hamza-Mandviwala/OCP4.10.3-install-GCP-UPI/blob/main/README.md#openshift-installation)  process directly. It would still be recommended to follow through this document entirely to avoid any unexpected issues.

The procedure and steps described in this document have been taken mainly from the official RedHat documentation for OpenShift (https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/installing/installing_gcp/installing-restricted-networks-gcp.html), with a few tweaks of my own.

YouTube video demonstrating this exercise : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdWCL4eE0vM

Some changes have been made to the original steps described in the official docs. These are mainly the creation of networks, subnetworks, DNS zones, Cloud NATs – for which we will walk you through the steps to be performed on the UI, instead of the CLI. The idea is to understand how the cluster looks from the ground up. 

We will also be skipping the steps of the intermediate service accounts required for worker & master nodes, instead we will be using the same service account that we will be creating initially for authentication and authorization.

*Do note that this is a private cluster deployment, and the cluster will only be accessible via the bastion host. This is why we do not use any public DNS in this installation, but only private DNS zone. We will however configure external UI access with the help of a reverse proxy.*

## Basic Flow and Summary of deployment steps

<img width="1792" alt="flowdiagram" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53118271/157832070-351606fa-92fd-45b7-96a2-e3fa7d83ddb0.png">

The above diagram illustrates the basic flow in which we will be deploying our OCP 4.10 cluster on GCP. We first create a bastion host, and from that host, we will be running all the necessary commands to setup the bootstrap node, followed by the Master nodes, and finally the worker nodes in a different subnet.

Before we begin the bootstrap process, we will be creating some prerequisite infrastructure components like network, subnetworks, IAM service account, IAM Project, Private DNS zone, Load balancers, Cloud NATs & a Cloud Router.

After the bootstrap process is complete, we will be removing all the bootstrap components from the cluster. And then we will proceed with the creation of the worker nodes.

Once we have our worker nodes up and running, we will configure a reverse proxy on the bastion host so that we can access the OCP Console UI locally on our browser. Finally, we will verify if all our cluster operators are showing as ‘Available’.

## Prerequisites:
1.	A GCP account.
2.	The necessary APIs to be enabled as per the documentation [here](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/installing/installing_gcp/installing-restricted-networks-gcp.html#installation-gcp-enabling-api-services_installing-restricted-networks-gcp). APIs are enabled on a project basis so you will be able to enable these APIs only once your project is created in step 1 below.
3.	Ensure you have [necessary limits/quotas](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/installing/installing_gcp/installing-restricted-networks-gcp.html#installation-gcp-limits_installing-restricted-networks-gcp) available in the region you wish to deploy your cluster into. Once your project is created in step 1 below & the necessary APIs have been enabled, please go ahead with ensuring the correct limits are set as mentioned in the docs.
4.	Basic Linux administration skills.
5.	Basic understanding of public cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, Azure.
6.	Understanding of IP, routing, reverse proxy (recommended).
8.	A RedHat account to download the necessary binaries (oc, kubectl & openshift-install binaries), RedHat coreos and the pull secret from. If you do not have a RedHat account, you can create one [here](https://www.redhat.com/wapps/ugc/register.html?_flowId=register-flow&_flowExecutionKey=e1s1).

## Steps:

### Creating GCP Infra components

1. Create a GCP project inside our GCP console. We have a project named ‘ocp-project’ created already, and this will be used to host the OCP 4.10 cluster.
   1. Go to **IAM & Admin** > **Create a Project**.
   2. Enter the project name & organization and click on *Create*.

2. Create a service account under IAM:
   1. Go to **IAM & admin** > **Service Accounts**
   2.	Click on **Create Service Account** and enter the relevant details:
         1.	Service Account name: *ocp-serviceaccount* (you can use any service account name of your choice)
         2.	Grant access to the necessary roles per the documentation. I have assigned it the **owner** role since I will be using this service account myself. It is however not recommended to grant the ‘owner’ role to the service account as it grants administrative privileges (full access) across your GCP account, and is not a security best practise. Do refer the necessary roles that the service account requires access to.
         3.	Click **Done**.
         4.	Once your service account is created, we need its json key to be used for authentication & authorization of gcp objects creation:
             1. Click on your service account name from the service accounts list.
             2. Go to the **keys** tab.
             3. Click on **Add key** > **Create New Key** and follow the instructions to create and download the json key.

**NOTE : Now that your project is created, first please enable the [necessary APIs](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/installing/installing_gcp/installing-restricted-networks-gcp.html#installation-gcp-enabling-api-services_installing-restricted-networks-gcp)  and then ensure you have the [necessary limits](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-user-infra.html#installation-gcp-limits_installing-gcp-user-infra) within your project. If you have newly created a GCP account, you might be able to edit your quotas only after 48 hours have passed by since account creation.**

3. Create a Network from the GCP UI Console:
   1.	Go to **VPC Networks** > **Create VPC Networks**
   2. Put in the appropriate network name. *ocp-network* is used in this exercise. (NOTE : *if you want to use different names for the network & subnetworks, and different IP subnet ranges; please ensure you also edit the sample-install-config.yaml file accordingly so that it contains the correct network & subnetwork names as well as the correct IP subnet ranges.*)
   3. Add 2 new subnets within this network:
         1. For the Master Nodes & Bootstrap node:
             1. Name: master-subnet
             2. Region: asia-northeast1 (*you can choose any region of your choice. In this exercise , asia-northeast1 is the nearest to my location and provides all necessary resource limits*)
             3. Subnet range: 10.1.10.0/24
             4.	Private Google Access: On
             5.	Flow Logs: Off
         2.	For the worker nodes:
             1.	Name: worker-subnet
             2.	Region: asia-northeast1 (*you can choose any region of your choice. In this exercise , asia-northeast1 is the nearest to my location and provides all necessary resource limits*)
             3.	Subnet Range: 10.1.20.0/24
             4.	Private Google Access: On
             5.	Flow Logs: Off
   4. For the Firewall rules, select all the 'allow' specific rules. Especially the rule that allows all communication between all the instances of the network. The rule name should be in the format of `<yournetworkname>-allow-custom`.
   5. Click **Create**.

4. Create a Firewall Rule to allow all traffic communication to and from the bastion host.
   1. Go to **'VPC Network'** > **'Firewall'**
   2. Enter the relevant details:
         1. Name: *allow-all-bastion*
         2. Logs: Off
         3. Network: ocp-network
         4. Priority: 100
         5. Direction of Traffic: Ingress
         6. Action on Match: Allow
         7. Targets: Specified Target Tags
            1. Target Tags: *'bastion'* (This is the network tag that will be assigned to the bastion host when it will be created).
         8. Source Filter: IPv4 Ranges
         9. Source IPv4 Ranges: 0.0.0.0/0
         10. Protocols & Ports: Allow All
         11. Click **Create**.

5. Create a ‘Cloud Router’ from the GCP console.
   1. Go to **‘Hybrid Connectivity’** > **‘Cloud Routers’**. (If *'Hybrid Connectivity'* option is not there in your left navigation menu, click on 'MORE PRODUCTS' option from the left navigation menu >  scroll down and you should find *'Hybrid Connectivity'* option. Click on the 'pin' icon so that it can be pinned to your pinned services list)
   2. Click on **‘Create Router’**.
   3.	Enter the relevant details:
         1. Name: ocp-router
         2. Network: ocp-network
         3. Region: asia-northeast1
         4. Select *“Advertise all subnets visible to the Cloud Router (Default)”*.
         5. Click **Create**..

6. Create 2 Cloud NAT components connected to the router we created above, for both of our subnets created earlier.
   1. Go to **‘Network Services’** > **‘Cloud NAT’**. (If *'Network Services'* option is not there in your left navigation menu, click on 'MORE PRODUCTS' option from the left navigation menu >  scroll down and you should find *'Network Services'* option. Click on the 'pin' icon so that it can be pinned to your pinned services list)
   2. Enter the relevant details:
         1. Gateway Name: ocp-nat-master-gw
         2. Network: ocp-network
         3. Region: asia-northeast1
         4. Cloud Router: ocp-router (this is the name of the cloud router we created in the previous step)
         5. NAT Mapping  
             1. Source: Custom
             2. Subnets: master-subnet
             3. NAT IP Addresses: Automatic
   3. Click **Create** .
   4. Repeat steps i, ii & iii again for the worker-subnet, and ensure you change the Gateway Name to ocp-nat-worker-gw for example. And ensure both Cloud NATs are connected to the same Cloud Router.

7. Create a private DNS zone from the GCP UI:
   1. Go to **‘Network Services’** > **‘Cloud DNS’**.
   2. Click on **‘Create Zone’** and enter the relevant details:
         1. Zone type: Private
         2. Zone name: ocp-private-zone (you can use any name of your choice)
         3. DNS name: hamzacluster.openshift.com (The DNS name consists of a combination of the cluster name & base domain i.e <cluster_name>.<base_domain> . In this example ‘hamzacluster’ is the name of my cluster and ‘openshift.com’ is the base domain that I will be using. Ensure you enter the values correctly as the cluster name & base domain you specify here will be the same that will have to be used in the install-config.yaml file later.
         4. Network: ocp-network (this needs to be the network we created earlier within which our master-subnet & worker-subnet reside)
         5.	Click **‘Create’**.

8. Create a bastion host in the master-subnet of the ocp-network we created earlier. Bastion host is basically a normal VM instance that can be used to log into and run the necessary commands from. Ensure it has an external IP assigned to it as we will be ssh’ing into it and run all the necessary commands from there.
   1. Go to **Compute Engine** > **‘VM Instances’** > **‘Create Instance’**.
   2. Put in the relevant details: Instance name, type (e2-medium is used for my demo), region, zone.
   3.	For the boot disk, I have used Ubuntu 18.04 OS with 50 GB disk size.
   4.	Identity & API Access:
         1. Service account: Compute Engine Default Service Account
         2. Access Scopes: Allow full access to all Cloud APIs (**This option is necessary as only then will you be able to execute the gcloud commands**)
   5. Firewall: Tick both checkboxes for allowing HTTP & HTTPS traffic.
   6.	For the Networking:
         1. Network Tags: *'bastion'* (Ensure you set this tag, so that the firewall rule we created in step 4 above is applicable to this bastion host)
         2. Assign a hostname of your choice. 
         3. Connect the network interface to the ocp-network, and subnet of master-subnet. You can set both Primary Internal IP & External IP to ‘Ephemeral’.
         4.	Keep IP forwarding enabled.
         5. Network Interface Card: VirtIO
   7.	Under **‘Security’** > **‘Manage Access’** -  ensure you add a ssh public key that allows you to ssh into the bastion host from your local machine.
   8.	Click **‘Create’**.

### OpenShift Installation 

9. SSH into the bastion host from your local machine, and switch to the root user. The *username* value is usually the local username that you use on your local machine. In my case, my local Macbook username is 'hamzawork' so I used 'hamzawork' as the username in the ssh command as well.
        
       ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa <username>@<Public IP of bastion host>
       sudo su -
10. Copy over the downloaded json key (from step 2 above) to your bastion host, and save it by the name of `service-account-key.json`, as this is the service account key filename referenced in some of our commands later in this exercise. You can choose any name, just ensure you edit the commands accordingly.

11. Download some important packages:

        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install wget git -y
    
12. Download the necessary cli binaries & files from your [RedHat Cluster Manager](https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=cloud-services&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.redhat.com%2F&state=1b3b6ba7-b426-4319-9197-8d4be1f14e5f&response_mode=fragment&response_type=code&scope=openid&nonce=72beef5c-277a-4dd7-a840-721e8eddbcac) login page onto the bastion host (you can use the wget tool to directly download onto your bastion host, or simply download them and copy over to your bastion host using scp):
    1. openshift-install cli binary
    2. oc cli binary
    3.	kubectl cli binary
    4.	RedHat Coreos image
    5.	Pull Secret
    6.	gcloud cli binary (Can be downloaded from [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install))
    7.	jq binary `sudo apt install jq -y`

13. Once downloaded and extracted, copy the openshift-install, oc & kubectl binary into /usr/local/bin/ directory (Or whatever the $PATH you have configured on your bastion host).
        
        tar xvf openshift-install-linux.tar.gz
        tar xvf openshift-client-linux.tar.gz
        mv oc kubectl openshift-install /usr/local/bin/


14. Generate a new ssh key pair on your bastion host keeping all default options. The public key from this key pair will be inserted in your install-config.yaml file. Your cluster nodes will be injected with this ssh key and you will be able to ssh into them later for any kind of monitoring & troubleshooting.
             
        ssh-keygen
      
15. Clone this repository. This contains the necessary .py files required to build the cluster components like load balancers & VM instances.

        git clone https://github.com/Hamza-Mandviwala/OCP4.10.3-install-GCP-UPI.git
        
    Also let's copy the Deployment Manager Templates (i.e the .py files, to the current working directory)
    
        cp ~/OCP4.10.3-install-GCP-UPI/deployment_manager_templates/* ~/ 
        
16. Create an installation directory which will be used to generate the manifests & ignition config files.

        mkdir install_dir

17. Copy the sample-install-config.yaml file into the installation directory.

        cp ~/OCP4.10.3-install-GCP-UPI/sample-install-config.yaml ~/install_dir/install-config.yaml
        
18. Edit the copied install-config.yaml as per your environment. The important changes are:
    1. Base Domain value (Needs to be the same as specified in your private DNS zone)
    2. Cluster name (Needs to be the same as specified in your private DNS zone)
    3. Pull Secret (To be taken from your RedHat account portal)
    4. SSH key (The one you created in step 14 above. The public key is present at `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` on most Linux machines)
    5. GCP platform specific parameters like project ID, region will have to specified per your choice. In this exercise, we have deployed our cluster in asia-northeast1 as it is the closest to my geographical location and has the necessary limits to host the cluster.

19. Export the GCP application credentials. This is the service account key that will be used for creating the remaining cluster components. We also need to login to the gcloud CLI:

        export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<full path to your service account key json file>
        gcloud auth login --cred-file=<your service account key json filename>
        
21. Create the manifest files for your OpenShift cluster.

        openshift-install create manifests --dir install_dir/
    
22. The manifests need some changes to be made as follows:
    1. Open the file install_dir/manifests/cluster-ingress-default-ingresscontroller.yaml 

           vi install_dir/manifests/cluster-ingress-default-ingresscontroller.yaml
           
    2. Under spec.endpointPublishingStrategy :
       1. Remove the ‘loadbalancer’ parameter completely so that only the ‘type’ section remains.
       2. For the ‘type’ parameter, change the value to ‘HostNetwork’.
       3. Add the parameter of ‘replicas: 2’ below the ‘type’.
       4. Your resulting file should have the section look something like:
                  
              spec:
                endpointPublishingStrategy:
                  type: HostNetwork
                  replicas: 2
                  
       5. Save the file.
     
       Refer the sample-cluster-ingress-default-ingresscontroller.yaml file to compare and see how the resulting file should look like.
       
    3. Remove the manifest files for the worker & master machines, as we will be creating the master & worker nodes using the Deployment Manager templates.
              
           rm -f install_dir/openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_master-machines-*
           rm -f install_dir/openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_worker-machineset-*

23. Now let’s create the ignition config files.

        openshift-install create ignition-configs --dir install_dir/
          
24. Set the environment variables for your environment. Please set the values as per your needs.

        export BASE_DOMAIN=openshift.com
        export BASE_DOMAIN_ZONE_NAME=ocp-private-zone
        export NETWORK=ocp-network
        export MASTER_SUBNET=master-subnet
        export WORKER_SUBNET=worker-subnet
        export NETWORK_CIDR='10.1.0.0/16'
        export MASTER_SUBNET_CIDR='10.1.10.0/24'
        export WORKER_SUBNET_CIDR='10.1.20.0/24'
        export KUBECONFIG=/root/install_dir/auth/kubeconfig 
        export CLUSTER_NAME=`jq -r .clusterName /root/install_dir/metadata.json`
        export INFRA_ID=`jq -r .infraID /root/install_dir/metadata.json`
        export PROJECT_NAME=`jq -r .gcp.projectID /root/install_dir/metadata.json`
        export REGION=`jq -r .gcp.region /root/install_dir/metadata.json`
        export CLUSTER_NETWORK=(`gcloud compute networks describe ${NETWORK} --format json | jq -r .selfLink`)
        export CONTROL_SUBNET=(`gcloud compute networks subnets describe ${MASTER_SUBNET} --region=${REGION} --format json | jq -r .selfLink`)
        export COMPUTE_SUBNET=(`gcloud compute networks subnets describe ${WORKER_SUBNET} --region=${REGION} --format json | jq -r .selfLink`)
        export ZONE_0=(`gcloud compute regions describe ${REGION} --format=json | jq -r .zones[0] | cut -d "/" -f9`)
        export ZONE_1=(`gcloud compute regions describe ${REGION} --format=json | jq -r .zones[1] | cut -d "/" -f9`)
        export ZONE_2=(`gcloud compute regions describe ${REGION} --format=json | jq -r .zones[2] | cut -d "/" -f9`)
      
    These environment variables will be required for the upcoming commands as they call these variables in them, so be sure to set these.


25. Now we create the internal loadbalancer component that will be used for api related communication by the cluster nodes. The following commands will create the load balancer, its corresponding health check component, as well as the backend empty instance groups into which the master nodes will be put into at the time of Master nodes creation in a later step.
    1. Create the `.yaml` file
       
           cat <<EOF >02_infra.yaml
           imports:
           - path: 02_lb_int.py 
           resources: 
           - name: cluster-lb-int
             type: 02_lb_int.py
             properties:
               cluster_network: '${CLUSTER_NETWORK}'
               control_subnet: '${CONTROL_SUBNET}' 
               infra_id: '${INFRA_ID}'
               region: '${REGION}'
               zones: 
               - '${ZONE_0}'
               - '${ZONE_1}'
               - '${ZONE_2}'
           EOF
    2. Create the corresponding GCP object:
    
           gcloud deployment-manager deployments create ${INFRA_ID}-infra --config 02_infra.yaml
           
           
26. We now need to get the Cluster IP. This is basically the loadbalancer IP that we created in the previous step. This IP is used as the Host IP addresses for the DNS record sets that will be put into our private DNS zone. 

        export CLUSTER_IP=(`gcloud compute addresses describe ${INFRA_ID}-cluster-ip --region=${REGION} --format json | jq -r .address`)
        
27. We now create the required record sets for api communication among the cluster nodes.

        if [ -f transaction.yaml ]; then rm transaction.yaml; fi
        gcloud dns record-sets transaction start --zone ocp-private-zone
        gcloud dns record-sets transaction add ${CLUSTER_IP} --name api.${CLUSTER_NAME}.${BASE_DOMAIN}. --ttl 60 --type A --zone ocp-private-zone
        gcloud dns record-sets transaction add ${CLUSTER_IP} --name api-int.${CLUSTER_NAME}.${BASE_DOMAIN}. --ttl 60 --type A --zone ocp-private-zone
        gcloud dns record-sets transaction execute --zone ocp-private-zone
       
28. Let’s export the service account emails as these will be called inside the deployment manager templates of our master & worker nodes. In our demo, we will be using the same service account we created earlier:

        export MASTER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=(`gcloud iam service-accounts list --filter "email~^ocp-serviceaccount@${PROJECT_NAME}." --format json | jq -r '.[0].email'`)
        export WORKER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=(`gcloud iam service-accounts list --filter "email~^ocp-serviceaccount@${PROJECT_NAME}." --format json | jq -r '.[0].email'`)
     
     If the above commands do not set the correct service account email ENV variable, you can try running `gcloud iam service-accounts list`, copy the email address for your service account from the output's email column and manually set it as the environment variable for both `MASTER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` & `WORKER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`.
     
29. Now let’s create 2 google cloud buckets. One will be for storing the bootstrap.ign file for the bootstrap node, and the other will be the one to store the RedHat Coreos image that the cluster nodes will pull to boot up from.
    1. Bucket to store bootstrap.ign file.
    
           gsutil mb gs://${INFRA_ID}-bootstrap-ignition
           gsutil cp install_dir/bootstrap.ign gs://${INFRA_ID}-bootstrap-ignition/
           
    2. Bucket to store RedHat Coreos file. Please take note that in the below commands, the filename of the rhcos image is `rhcos-4.10.3-x86_64-gcp.x86_64.tar.gz`. In your case the name might be different, so please replace the value accordingly. Also, the bucket names need to be unique globally, so in your case, you might be unable to use the bucket name as *'rhcosbucket'*, instead you can use any other arbitrary name of your choice, and just ensure you replace the the name correctly in any of the commands referencing the bucket name.

           gsutil mb gs://rhcosbucket/
           gsutil cp rhcos-4.10.3-x86_64-gcp.x86_64.tar.gz gs://rhcosbucket/
           export IMAGE_SOURCE=gs://rhcosbucket/rhcos-4.10.3-x86_64-gcp.x86_64.tar.gz
           gcloud compute images create "${INFRA_ID}-rhcos-image" --source-uri="${IMAGE_SOURCE}"
           
30. Let’s set the CLUSTER_IMAGE env to be called later by the node creation commands.

        export CLUSTER_IMAGE=(`gcloud compute images describe ${INFRA_ID}-rhcos-image --format json | jq -r .selfLink`)

31. Let’s set the BOOTSTRAP_IGN env to be called in the next step of bootstrap node creation.
       
        export BOOTSTRAP_IGN=`gsutil signurl -d 1h service-account-key.json gs://${INFRA_ID}-bootstrap-ignition/bootstrap.ign | grep "^gs:" | awk '{print $5}'`

32. Now we create the bootstrap node itself using the relevant Deployment Manager template. The below commands will create the bootstrap node, a public IP for it, and an empty instance group for the bootstrap node:
    1. Create the `.yaml` config file for the bootstrap node deployment:
    
           cat <<EOF >04_bootstrap.yaml
           imports:
           - path: 04_bootstrap.py

           resources:
           - name: cluster-bootstrap
             type: 04_bootstrap.py
             properties:
               infra_id: '${INFRA_ID}' 
               region: '${REGION}' 
               zone: '${ZONE_0}' 

               cluster_network: '${CLUSTER_NETWORK}' 
               control_subnet: '${CONTROL_SUBNET}' 
               image: '${CLUSTER_IMAGE}' 
               machine_type: 'e2-standard-2' 
               root_volume_size: '50' 

               bootstrap_ign: '${BOOTSTRAP_IGN}' 
           EOF
    2. Run the command to create the bootstrap node.

           gcloud deployment-manager deployments create ${INFRA_ID}-bootstrap --config 04_bootstrap.yaml
           
        
33. Now we need to manually add the bootstrap node to the new empty instance group and add it as part of the internal load balancer we created earlier. This is mandatory as the initial temporary bootstrap cluster is hosted on the bootstrap node.

        gcloud compute instance-groups unmanaged add-instances ${INFRA_ID}-bootstrap-instance-group --zone=${ZONE_0} --instances=${INFRA_ID}-bootstrap
        gcloud compute backend-services add-backend ${INFRA_ID}-api-internal-backend-service --region=${REGION} --instance-group=${INFRA_ID}-bootstrap-instance-group --instance-group-zone=${ZONE_0}

34. We now proceed with the master nodes creation. Note that we are using instance types e2-standard-4, but you can use any other type which suits you best. However please ensure the type you choose accommodates at least 16GB Memory and 4 vCPUs, as OCP will not be able to run the required containers on lower spec instance types. I have tried many times and it has usually failed or has been unstable.
    1. Set the env variable for the master ignition config file.

           export MASTER_IGNITION=`cat install_dir/master.ign`

    2. Create the `.yaml` config file for the master nodes deployment:

           cat <<EOF >05_control_plane.yaml
           imports:
           - path: 05_control_plane.py

           resources:
           - name: cluster-control-plane
             type: 05_control_plane.py
             properties:
               infra_id: '${INFRA_ID}' 
               zones: 
               - '${ZONE_0}'
               - '${ZONE_1}'
               - '${ZONE_2}'

               control_subnet: '${CONTROL_SUBNET}' 
               image: '${CLUSTER_IMAGE}' 
               machine_type: 'e2-standard-4' 
               root_volume_size: '100'
               service_account_email: '${MASTER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT}' 

               ignition: '${MASTER_IGNITION}' 
           EOF
      
      3. Run the command to create the master nodes:
    
        gcloud deployment-manager deployments create ${INFRA_ID}-control-plane --config 05_control_plane.yaml
        
35. Once the master nodes have been deployed, we also need to add them to their respective instance groups that were created earlier in the load balancer creation step:

        gcloud compute instance-groups unmanaged add-instances ${INFRA_ID}-master-${ZONE_0}-instance-group --zone=${ZONE_0} --instances=${INFRA_ID}-master-0
        gcloud compute instance-groups unmanaged add-instances ${INFRA_ID}-master-${ZONE_1}-instance-group --zone=${ZONE_1} --instances=${INFRA_ID}-master-1
        gcloud compute instance-groups unmanaged add-instances ${INFRA_ID}-master-${ZONE_2}-instance-group --zone=${ZONE_2} --instances=${INFRA_ID}-master-2
        
36. At this point we must now wait for the bootstrap process to complete. You can now monitor the bootstrap process:
    1. ssh into your bootstrap node from your bastion host (`ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa core@<ip of your bootstrap node>`) and run `journalctl -b -f -u release-image.service -u bootkube.service` . Upon bootstrap process completion, the output of this command should stop at a message that looks something like `systemd[1]: bootkube.service: Succeeded`. 
    2. You can also ssh into the master nodes from your bastion host (`ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa core@<ip of your master node>`) and run a `sudo crictl ps` to monitor the container creation of the various OCP components. Sometimes the kube-apiserver & etcd related components fluctuate and keep flapping. Do not panic and allow some time for these to stabilize. You can also perform a rolling reboot of your master nodes if you wish to.

37. Once our bootstrap process completes, we can remove the bootstrap components:

        gcloud compute backend-services remove-backend ${INFRA_ID}-api-internal-backend-service --region=${REGION} --instance-group=${INFRA_ID}-bootstrap-instance-group --instance-group-zone=${ZONE_0}
        gsutil rm gs://${INFRA_ID}-bootstrap-ignition/bootstrap.ign
        gsutil rb gs://${INFRA_ID}-bootstrap-ignition
        gcloud deployment-manager deployments delete ${INFRA_ID}-bootstrap

38. Now we are good to create the worker nodes. Note that if we run an `oc get co` command from the bastion host at this time, we will still see a few operators as *'unavailable'*, typically the ingress, console, authentication, and a few other cluster operators. This is because they depend on some components which need to come up on the worker nodes. For example, the ingress cluster operator will deploy the router pods on the worker nodes by default, and only then will a route to the console be created, and eventually the authentication operator would also reach completion.
    1. Set the env variable for the worker ignition config file.

           export WORKER_IGNITION=`cat install_dir/worker.ign`

    2. Create the *.yaml* file for the worker nodes deployment.

           cat <<EOF >06_worker.yaml
           imports:
           - path: 06_worker.py

           resources:
           - name: 'worker-0' 
             type: 06_worker.py
             properties:
               infra_id: '${INFRA_ID}' 
               zone: '${ZONE_0}' 
               compute_subnet: '${COMPUTE_SUBNET}' 
               image: '${CLUSTER_IMAGE}' 
               machine_type: 'e2-standard-4' 
               root_volume_size: '100'
               service_account_email: '${WORKER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT}' 
               ignition: '${WORKER_IGNITION}' 
           - name: 'worker-1'
             type: 06_worker.py
             properties:
               infra_id: '${INFRA_ID}' 
               zone: '${ZONE_1}' 
               compute_subnet: '${COMPUTE_SUBNET}' 
               image: '${CLUSTER_IMAGE}' 
               machine_type: 'e2-standard-4' 
               root_volume_size: '100'
               service_account_email: '${WORKER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT}' 
               ignition: '${WORKER_IGNITION}' 
           EOF
        Note: If you wish to deploy workers with 2 interfaces, replace the `type` parameter value with `07_worker_with_2_interfaces.py` AND add an extra property field named `additional_subnet` and set it's value to the output of the command `gcloud compute networks subnets describe <secondary_network_name> --region=${REGION} --format json | jq -r .selfLink` where `<secondary_network_name>` is the name of another VPC network to which you wish to attach your VMs to. 
     3. Run the command to create the worker nodes.

            gcloud deployment-manager deployments create ${INFRA_ID}-worker --config 06_worker.yaml

39. With the node deployments created, there should be 2 CSRs in a pending state, we need to approve these. Once we approve the first 2, there will be 2 additional CSRs generated by those nodes, therefore, 4 CSRs (in sequence of 2 CSRs each) in total that we must approve.

        oc get csr
        oc adm certificate approve <csr name>

40. Now if we run `oc get nodes`, we should be able to see the worker nodes too. 

### Creating a second Internal Load Balancer for worker plane traffic 

NOTE: *The steps in this section are needed so that we can have a single IP address to which our `*.apps` traffic can be forwarded to and eventually be loadbalanced between the worker nodes. Alternatively, you can skip creating this second load balancer, and instead, when creating the wildcard DNS entry for `*.apps` you can opt for 'weighted round robin' Routing Policy and simply add the IP addresses of both worker nodes with a weight of 1000 for each. In production, however, it is advisable to take the approach of a load balancer so that it can become scalable, and new worker nodes can be added easily to the cluster without impacting any application routing.*

40. We will now create 2 new unmanaged instance groups for each of our worker nodes. This is because, later we will be creating another internal load balancer that will forward the worker plane specific traffic.
    1. Go to **‘Compute Engine’** > **‘Instance Groups’**.
    2. Click on **‘Create Instance Group’** and select **‘New unmanaged instance group’**.
    3. Enter the relevant details like name, region & zone. Ensure region & zone is the same as where our worker nodes reside.
    4. For networking options:
       1.	Network: ocp-network (Name of your network that hosts the cluster)
       2. Subnetwork: worker-subnet (needs to be the name of your worker nodes subnet)
       3. VM Instances: Select one of the worker nodes from the drop-down list.
    5. Click **‘Create’**.
    6.	Repeat steps i., ii., iii.,iv. & v. for creating a second instance group that will have the second worker node in it. 

41. Now we create a new internal load balancer that will have the 2 instance groups we created in the previous step as backends:
    1. Go to **‘Network Services’** > **‘Loadbalancing’**.
    2. Click on **‘Create Load Balancer’** > Select **‘TCP load balancing’**.
    3. Select the following options:
       1. Internet facing or Internal only: *Only Between my VMs*
       2. Multiple regions or Single region: *Single Region* 
       3. Click **‘Continue’**
    4. Enter the name & region.
    5. For the network, select your network name to which your VM Instances are connected. (‘ocp-network ‘in this exercise).
    6. For **Backend Configuration**:
       1. Select one of the instance groups we created in the previous step, click Done.
       2. Add another backend by selecting the second instance group we created in the previous step, click Done.
       3.	For the HealthCheck, click on **‘Create a Health Check’** and:
              1. Enter the name e.g  wildcard-apps-healthcheck 
              2. Scope: Regional
              3. Protocol: TCP
              4. Port: 443
              5. Proxy Protocol: None
              6. Logs: Off
              7. Leave the Health Criteria parameters to the default.
              8. Click **Save**.
    7. For the **Frontend Configuration**:
       1. You can give it a name if you want to, we have left it blank for this exercise.
       2. Subnetwork: master-subnet
       3. Internal IP – Purpose: Shared
          1. IP Address: Ephemeral (Automatic)
       4. Ports: All
       5. Global Access: Disable
       6. Click **Done**.
    8. Click **‘Create’**.
    9. From the load balancers list, click on the name of the newly created load balancer and take note of the Frontend IP address. This will be the IP address that will be used for our new DNS record set in the next step.
 
 <img width="628" alt="Screenshot 2022-03-12 at 4 28 22 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53118271/158013614-5d0863e2-4baa-473b-b663-30f4026d941b.png">

42. Now let’s add a new DNS record set for the wildcard of `*.apps.<cluster name>.<base domain>` to our private DNS zone. This DNS record is very important and is required for the ingress cluster operator to be able to listen and receive ingress traffic from the Master nodes. At this time, the console pods & authentication pods on the master nodes try to repeatedly connect with the ingress (router) pods to establish a legit route for their respective path endpoints. Because of the absence of this record set in step 37 above, some of the cluster operators remain unavailable.
    1. Go to **‘Network Services’** > **‘Cloud DNS’**.
    2. Select the private DNS zone we created earlier.
    3. Click on **‘Add Record Set’**.
    4. Enter the DNS name as `*.apps`. The clustername & basedomain should get auto-filled.
    5. Set TTL value to 1 and TTL Unit to minutes.
    6. Resource Record Type: A
    7. Routing Policy: Default Record Type
    8. IP Address: 10.1.10.9 (This needs to be the IP of the loadbalancer created in the previous step).
    9. Click **‘Create’**.

 
Once this is done, run a `watch oc get co`, and you should start seeing all your Cluster Operators becoming 'Available'.
 
### Configuring a Reverse Proxy for external UI access
 
43. Now that our cluster is entirely setup, we still cannot access the UI externally since it is a private cluster and only configured to expose it internally within the GCP network. For this, we will configure a reverse proxy on our bastion host:
    1. Install the haproxy package.
                
           sudo apt install haproxy -y
  
    2. Open the haproxy.cfg file to make some configuration changes.

           vi /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
 
    3. Add the following section in the end, and save it:

           frontend localhost
               bind *:80
               bind *:443
               option tcplog
               mode tcp
               default_backend servers
 
           backend servers
               mode tcp
               server hamzacluster.openshift.com 10.1.10.9 # Please change the IP address to the IP address of your Internal worker plane Loadbalancer, and the DNS name to your private DNS name
         
         You can make use of the sample-haproxy.cfg file from the GitHub repository to compare your haproxy configuration.

    4. Once the haproxy is configured, restart it: `systemctl restart haproxy`.
    5.	Run an `oc get routes -A` command to get the Console URL through which you can access.
    6. On your local machine, add an entry in the `/etc/hosts` file (Linux & Mac Users) that points to the Public IP of your bastion host for the name address of all the OpenShift Services that have been created e.g prometheus, grafana, alert manager etc. For Windows Users, you might have to add the entry into `c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts`.

       Something like :

           <Bastion host Public IP> downloads-openshift-console.apps.hamzacluster.openshift.com alertmanager-main-openshift-monitoring.apps.hamzacluster.openshift.com grafana-openshift-monitoring.apps.hamzacluster.openshift.com prometheus-k8s-openshift-monitoring.apps.hamzacluster.openshift.com thanos-querier-openshift-monitoring.apps.hamzacluster.openshift.com console-openshift-console.apps.hamzacluster.openshift.com oauth-openshift.apps.hamzacluster.openshift.com

    7. You should now be able to access the OCP console UI through your browser using `https://console-openshift-console.apps.<clustername>.<basedomain>`.


Your OpenShift 4.10 cluster is now up and running. You can login to your UI using the username of 'kubeadmin' and the password present in `install_dir/auth/kubeadmin-password`
